            <p>
              With a solid foundation in designing, developing and deploying
              high-quality web applications, I bring both technical skills and
              practical experience to every project.

            <p>
              I’m a certified Full Stack Software Developer from GoMyCode Kenya,
              specializing in MERN stack development. Beyond web technologies, I
              have hands-on experience with multiple programming languages
              including Python, C#, and Java, and I’ve also worked on mobile
              applications using Android Studio with proficiency in Java and
              Kotlin.
